Book Nook - Fullstack Web Application: Allows users to rent, checkout, and return books and media, pay late or damaged 
fees, and allows admins to create, update, or delete users, books, and media and generate revenue reports. The technologies my team and I used to build this application are React, TailwindCSS, Node.js, and SQL.
